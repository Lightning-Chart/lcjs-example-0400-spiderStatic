# JavaScript Static Spider Chart

![JavaScript Static Spider Chart](spiderStatic-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

_Also known as Radar Chart, Web Chart, Polar Chart, Star Series_

This example shows the creation and API of Spider Chart, which is generally used to compare multivariate quantitative data set. Each quantitative variable is represented on a categorical axis starting from the same center point.

Typical usage of the Radar (Spider) chart is to compare various products over a range of characteristics.

Spider Charts are created in a very straight-forward manner:

```javascript
// Add a Spider Chart.
const spiderChart = Spider()
```

Spider Series provides an ability to specify styles for both markers and lines individually.

```javascript
const spiderSeries = spiderChart
    .addSeries()
    .setName('Positive feedback distribution')
    .setFillStyle(fillStyle)
    .setPointFillStyle(pointFillStyle)
// etc ...
```

Actual data is added with the format: `{ axis: string, value: number }`, where 'axis' refers to the name of a category.

```javascript
spiderSeries.addPoints(
    // Any number of { axis, value } pairs can be passed.
    { axis: 'Team spirit', value: 55 },
    { axis: 'Premises', value: 27 },
    { axis: 'Salary', value: 25 },
)
```

Adding points with unique tags will automatically create new categorical axes for the Spider Chart in the order of adding (the first axis will always point directly up and following ones will traverse clock-wise). Adding more points to the same category tag in one series will override any previous values.
